# PhononTools

### Description
Python scripts/programs to analyze the results from the yaml files generated by [Phonopy](https://github.com/phonopy/phonopy).

## Functionality
As of now, a user can:

- [x] Plot the phonon dispersion (including a weighted dispersion, where the weights are given by the modulus of the in-plane and out-plane eigenvectors for a given phonon mode and q-point vector.

- [x] Plot the phonon density of states.
- [x] Plot bands and density of states.

- [x] Analyze the normal modes at a given q-point vector.
  - [x] Write the irreducible representation of the phonon modes.
  - [x] Produce dictionaries of eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each phonon mode.
